                I previously particpated more in extracurricular 
                activities and organizations, as of lately I have 
                fallen apart, lost motivation, lost track, and ultimately 
                feel as if I've lost myself in the midst of it all. 
                But when I did previously engage in school, besides 
                fencing, I was a part of the <i>Office of Undergraduate Research</i>.
