                This is my attempt at making a resume using GitHub pages, 
                something that I admittedly have no experience in beyond
                what I have learned from the provided videos and what I 
                have learned from the mid-term project. Of course it won't
                be entirely accurate, for the sake of privacy, but I will
                do my best to fulfill most of the requirements despite my 
                severe lack of knowledge. I am doing this as my final 
                project for 
                <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/missouri/courses/INFOTC/1000/">Information Technology 1000</a>,
                Section 01, and I hope I don't dissappoint too much.
