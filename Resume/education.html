                Ironically, despite this being my education page,
                 I'm not exactly sure how well educated I would 
                 consider myself as of right now, and to no fault 
                 of anyone's but my own. But in spite of that, I 
                 was originally empassioned to join IT due to the 
                 many doors it opened into the entertainment industry, 
                 hence the Certificate in Media Technology Design and 
                 a Minor in Art.
